## Model Structure

The LMIC reports are generated using an age-structured SEIR model, with the infectious class divided into different stages reflecting progression through different disease severity pathways. These compartments are:

* S = Susceptibles 
* E = Exposed (Latent Infection) 
* IMild = Mild Infections (Not Requiring Hospitalisation) â€“ including asymptomatic infection 
* ICase = Infections that will subsequently require hospitalisation 
* IHospital = Hospitalised Infection (Requires General Hospital Bed) 
* IICU = Hospitalised Infection in critical care/ICU (Requires critical care/ICU Bed) 
* IRec = Hospitalised Infection Recovering from critical care/ICU Stay (Requires General Hospital Bed) 
* R = Recovered 
* D = Dead

<br>

Given initial inputs of hospital/ICU bed capacity and the average time cases spend in hospital, the model dynamically tracks available hospital and ICU beds over time. Individuals newly requiring hospitalisation (either a hospital or ICU bed) are then assigned to either receive care (if the relevant bed is available) or not (if maximum capacity would be exceeded otherwise). Whether or not an individual receives the required care modifies their probability of dying.

We have incorporated the impact of interventions that have been put in place using data from the [Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker). We currently make assumptions about the efficacy of these interventions. We assume that  and so the projections should be interpreted as scenarios rather than predictions. Work is ongoing to integrate formal statistical fitting to improve these projections. In summary, school closures are assumed to cause a 10% reduction in contacts. Work closure is assumed to cause 30% reduction in contacts. Banning of public events is assumed to lead to a 5% reduction in contacts while a lockdown is not in force. A lockdown is assumed to cause an additional 37.5% reduction in contacts on top of the 40% reduction due to school and work closure, leading to a total 77.5% reduction.

## Model Parameters

The parameter table below summarises the current best estimates incorporated in the package as of `r date`. These will be updated as our understanding of the epidemic develops.

| **Parameter** | **Value** | **Reference** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Basic reproductive number, R0 | 3.0 | [Report 13](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-13-europe-npi-impact/) |
| Mean Incubation Period | 4.6 days | [Report 9](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-9-impact-of-npis-on-covid-19/); [Linton et al.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2020/01/28/2020.01.26.20018754.full.pdf); [Li et al.](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316) The last 0.5 days are included in the I_MILD and I_CASE states to capture pre-symptomatic infectivity |
| Generation Time | 6.75 days | [Report 9](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/covid-19/report-9-impact-of-npis-on-covid-19/) |
| Mean Duration in I\_MILD | 2.1 days | Incorporates 0.5 days of infectiousness prior to symptoms; with parameters below ~95% of all infections are mild. In combination with mean duration in I\_CASE this gives a mean generation time as above |
| Mean Duration in I\_CASE | 4.5 days | Mean onset-to-admission of 4 days from UK data. Includes 0.5 days of infectiousness prior to symptom onset |
| Mean Duration of Hospitalisation for non-critical Cases (I\_HOSP) if survive | 9.5 days | Based on unpublished UK data |
| Mean Duration of Hospitalisation for non-critical Cases (I\_HOSP) if die | 7.6 days | Based on unpublished UK data |
| Mean duration of Critical Care (I\_ICU) if survive | 11.3 days | Based on [UK data](https://www.icnarc.org/Our-Audit/Audits/Cmp/Reports) adjusted for censoring |
| Mean duration of Critical Care (I\_ICU) if die | 10.1 days | Based on [UK data](https://www.icnarc.org/Our-Audit/Audits/Cmp/Reports) |
| Mean duration of Stepdown post ICU (I\_Rec) | 3.4 days | Based on unpublished UK data |
| Mean duration of hospitalisation if require ICU but do not receive it | 1 day | Working assumption |
| Probability of dying in critical care | 50% | Based on [UK data](https://www.icnarc.org/Our-Audit/Audits/Cmp/Reports) |
| Probability of death if require critical care but do not receive it | 95% | Working assumption based on expert clinical opinion |
| Probability of death if require hospitalisation but do not receive it | 60% | Working assumption based on expert clinical opinion |
| Multiplier of duration of stay for LIC and LMIC settings compared to HIC | 50% | Working assumption based on expert clinical opinion |
